            I am a student studying at Ngee Ann Polytechnic who has an interest in 
            Information Technology and programming in general, always interested 
            in finding out more about what I can learn and I am capable of. I 
            operate well when working in both a group and by my own self, and 
            respond well to any changes that are made during the process. I also 
            have a personal hobby and intense passion of developing games and 
            worldbuilding and have gained experience from such things as well. I 
            am looking for a job that enables me to test out my skills that I have 
            gained and to also gain work experience along the way.
